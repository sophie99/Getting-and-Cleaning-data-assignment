##This CodeBook describes how the Data in the "UCI HAR Dataset" have been processed and cleaned according to the course project assignments.

#Data Source

The original dataset was acquired from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. Info concerning the original dataset:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Explanation of Scripts 

Assignment 1.The six txt files in train and test folder were imported as dataframes by using read.table function. Those dataframes were then combined with rbind() and cbind() function to generate a merged dataframe called "MergeAll".

Assignment 2. "MergeAll" dataframe was subset to extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement with corresponding column names. 

Assignment 3. In original data, different activity types were represented by numbers.This step replaced the number with corresponding descriptive activity names(Walking,Walking Upstairs,Walking Downstairs,Sitting,Standing,Laying). 

Assignment 4. Some of the variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names by using gsub() function. 

Assignment 5. With melt () cast() (reshape package) the data was summarized to display the mean for each subject and activity combination of all variables. Arrange the cleaned data The final set has 180 rows & 68 columns (tidy_data.txt).
